Key Analysis Performed

Data Cleaning & Preparation: handled missing values, validated integrity, ensured consistency.

Trend Analysis: sales and profit trends over time.

Regional Analysis: sales distribution and profit across US regions.

Channel Performance: revenue and profit by Wholesale, Distributor, and Export.

Product Insights: top-performing products by revenue and margin.

Budget vs Actual: comparison of planned vs achieved revenue.

Advanced Visuals: heatmaps, opportunity matrix, and cumulative growth analysis.

Key Insights

Wholesale dominates sales (~$670M revenue, ~$248M profit).

Export lags in revenue but has higher profit margins (~38%), showing growth potential.

West region leads in revenue, but opportunities exist in the Northeast.

Top products (e.g., Product 25 & 26) contribute disproportionately to revenue.

Seasonal effects observed in Q1 and Q4 sales peaks.
